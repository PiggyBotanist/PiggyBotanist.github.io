title: "Visualizing Simple Geographic Data"

# Introduction

This week's data from Tidy Tuesday is some demographic data about different
countries from the CIA Factbook. It can be accessed 
[here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-10-22/readme.md).
We will use this data to create a simple map of the world showing the number of 
internet users per capita.

**Note:** this first project contains some more advanced operations. You do not
need to fully understand every operation and command. Instead, use this as an
exercise to get familiar with navigating RStudio and running R scripts. 

# R Code

If you haven't installed R or R Studio, make sure to visit the 
[quick start]({{ site.baseurl }}/quickstart.html).

You can view the entire R script on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Koshkov/r-for-info-studies/blob/main/activites/week2.R).

## Setup 

The first thing we have to do is load into `tidyverse` our environment and 
pull the dataset from Tidy Tuesday. 

```
library(tidyverse)
library(countrycode)

tuesdata<-tidytuesdayR::tt_load("2024-10-22") 
factbook_df<-tuesdata$cia_factbook
```
If we want to view our data, we can run the `View` command on the newly imported 
data frame. This will open our data into a new tab in RStudio. 
```
View(tuesdata$cia_factbook)
```

Next, we will introduce the pipe symbol `%>%`. This special operator allows us
to take the output of an R command and *push* or *pipe* it into another function.

In this simple example, we will summarize our data using the pipe symbol. 
The `summary` function gives us a high-level overview of our data.
```
factbook_df %>% summary()
```

## Creating a Base Map

First, we will build a simple world map using `ggplot2`. This package is 
included in `tidyverse` and allows us to create nicely formatted graphic including
scatter plots, bar charts, maps, and much more. It is a versatile tool commonly 
used in data visualization.

We begin by storing the geographical data  in a variable for later use.
```
map.base<-map_data("world") 
```
Then, we will use this data to draw a blank map of the world.
In this example, we will be using the `geom_polygon` function. This function 
draws shapes on our chart, making it a natural choice for geographic data.
```
map.base %>% 
    filter(region != "Antarctica")%>% # Remove Antarctica 
    ggplot(
        aes(x=long, y=lat)
    )+
    geom_polygon(
        aes(group=group),
        color="black"
    )+
    theme_void()
```

This will result in the following figure.

## Data Cleaning

We will need to check how much overlap we have between our two datasets. Even
though they both capture geographic data about countries, they do not use the 
same naming conventions for those countries. Using the `anti_join` function, we
can see what countries are not shared between our datasets.
```
factbook_df %>% 
   rename(region = country) %>%
   anti_join(map.base, by="region")
```
To reduce this overlap, we will use a function called `countrycode` which 
allows us to convert English language names to other more standardized formats.
In this example, we will convert our country names to the ISO three digit format
using the `mutate` function.

Additionally, we will remove any country that does not have population data
or internet user data as they will cause problems with our calculations later on. We 
can use the `is.na` function from the base R package to remove any unwanted
empty values.
```
factbook_df_iso<-factbook_df %>% 
    # Remove any country that does not have population or internet user data
    filter(!is.na(population) & !is.na(internet_users)) %>%
    # Convert name to ISO 3 Numeric char standard 
    mutate(iso=countrycode(country, origin="country.name", destination = "iso3n"))
```
We will repeat the process with our `map.base` data.
```
map_base_iso<-map.base %>%
    # Remove Antarctica from the map
    filter(region != "Antarctica")%>%
    # Convert name to ISO 3 Numeric char standard 
    mutate(iso=countrycode(region, origin="country.name", destination = "iso3n"))
 ```
When this is done, we review the anti-join result and find that it is much better!
Now we only have 7 countries that don't overlap instead of 49!
 ```
factbook_df_iso %>% 
    anti_join(map_base_iso, by="iso")
```

Next, we join our data using the left join on the newly created country codes.
```
map_df<- map_base_iso %>%
    left_join(factbook_df_iso, by="iso")
```

Finally, we use `ggplot` to create a map of the per capita internet users
in each country.
```
map_df %>% 
    ggplot(
        aes(x=long, y=lat)
    )+
    geom_polygon(
        aes(group=group, fill=((internet_users/population)*100)),
        color="black"
    )+
    theme_void()+labs(title="Intenet Users Per Capita")
```
