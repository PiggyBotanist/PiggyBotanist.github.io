# Quality Assessment in Sequence Assembly

## What is Quality Assessment in Sequence Assembly?

Quality assessment in sequence assembly is the process of evaluating the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of assembled genomes or transcriptomes. This step is crucial to ensure that the final assembled sequence accurately represents the target genome and is free from errors, such as misassemblies, gaps, or incorrect bases.

Quality assessment is typically performed using various **metrics**, **tools**, and **methods** that allow researchers to evaluate the performance of assembly algorithms and determine whether the assembly is suitable for downstream analyses, such as gene annotation, variant calling, or comparative genomics.

## Why is Quality Assessment Important?

1. **Ensuring Accuracy**: Accurate sequence assemblies are necessary to make valid biological inferences. Misassemblies or incorrect contig joins can lead to erroneous conclusions in downstream analyses.
   
2. **Assembly Completeness**: Quality assessment ensures that the assembly is complete and that no important regions (such as gene sequences or regulatory regions) are missing.
   
3. **Assessing Assembly Tools**: Different assemblers may produce assemblies with different levels of accuracy and completeness. Assessing the quality of each assembler’s output allows researchers to choose the best tool for the job.

4. **Facilitating Downstream Applications**: Many downstream applications (like functional annotation, variant calling, and comparative genomics) rely on high-quality assemblies. Low-quality assemblies can undermine the accuracy of these analyses.

## Key Metrics for Assembly Quality

### 1. **N50/N90 (Contig and Scaffold Metrics)**

- **N50**: The N50 is the length of the shortest contig or scaffold that, when ordered from longest to shortest, accounts for 50% of the total assembly length. It is a measure of assembly continuity; a larger N50 value typically indicates a more contiguous assembly.
  
- **N90**: Similar to N50, but it accounts for 90% of the total assembly length. A higher N90 value indicates a more complete and contiguous assembly.

### 2. **Contig/Scaffold Count**

- The number of contigs or scaffolds in an assembly is an important metric. A low contig count often indicates a more complete assembly with fewer gaps, while a high contig count suggests fragmented assembly. This metric can help evaluate the success of assembly in resolving large genomic regions.

### 3. **Genome Coverage**

- Genome coverage measures how well the entire genome is represented in the assembled sequences. This metric is usually reported as the **coverage depth**, indicating how many times each base has been sequenced. High coverage ensures that all genomic regions are likely to be covered by reads.

### 4. **Base Quality**

- **Base quality** refers to the accuracy of the nucleotides in the assembly. Base errors can occur during sequencing or assembly, so this metric evaluates how likely a base is to be incorrect. A higher base quality indicates a more reliable assembly.

### 5. **GC Content**

- GC content is the proportion of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) bases in the assembly. This metric can help assess whether the assembly is representative of the organism’s genome, as abnormal GC content may indicate assembly issues or contamination.

### 6. **Error Rate (Misassemblies and Gaps)**

- Misassemblies refer to errors in the sequence assembly, such as incorrect joins of contigs or the placement of repeats. Quality assessment tools often provide estimates of the error rate, helping to identify potential misassemblies.
- **Gaps** in the assembly indicate missing regions, which may arise due to repetitive sequences or low coverage.

## Tools for Quality Assessment

Several software tools are available for quality assessment in sequence assembly. These tools allow users to evaluate multiple metrics and generate reports on the quality of their assembly.

### 1. **QUAST (Quality Assessment Tool for Genome Assemblies)**

- **QUAST** is one of the most widely used tools for evaluating the quality of genome assemblies. It generates comprehensive reports on various metrics such as N50, contig count, and genome coverage. It can also compare assemblies to a reference genome to identify errors and misassemblies.

### 2. **BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs)**

- **BUSCO** is a tool designed to assess the completeness of genome assemblies by evaluating the presence of universal single-copy orthologs (genes that are highly conserved across species). BUSCO provides a metric for how many of the expected genes are present in the assembly, offering a measure of completeness.

### 3. **CheckM**

- **CheckM** assesses the completeness and contamination of microbial genome assemblies. It uses a set of conserved marker genes to calculate the percentage of complete, fragmented, and missing genes in an assembly, making it especially useful for metagenomic studies.

### 4. **FastQC**

- While typically used for quality control of raw sequencing data, **FastQC** can also be helpful for quality assessment in assembly pipelines by providing insight into the quality of the reads that were used for assembly.

### 5. **PACA (Pangenome Assembly Completeness Assessment)**

- **PACA** is used to assess the quality of pangenome assemblies by measuring the completeness of the assembly in terms of core and accessory genomes.

### 6. **Longer Read Specific Tools**

- Tools like **NanoPlot** and **NanoQC** provide quality control and quality assessment of long-read data (e.g., from Oxford Nanopore or PacBio), helping to ensure that long reads do not introduce high error rates or gaps during hybrid assembly.

## Methods of Quality Assessment

1. **Comparative Assessment**

   One approach to quality assessment is to compare the assembly to a reference genome (if available). Tools like **QUAST** and **BUSCO** allow for alignment-based assessments of assembly quality, comparing how well the assembly matches known reference sequences or conserved gene sets.

2. **Alignment to Known Genes or Markers**

   For organisms with well-characterized genomes, you can align the assembled sequences to known **gene markers** or **orthologous genes**. This helps assess whether the assembly correctly includes critical genomic regions.

3. **Error Detection and Correction**

   After assessing the raw quality metrics, tools such as **Pilon** can be used to correct errors in assemblies. These tools improve the base quality and correct misassemblies by re-aligning short reads to the assembled sequences and identifying discrepancies.

4. **Gap Filling**

   Gap filling tools, like **GapCloser** and **Sealer**, can be employed to fill in gaps in the assembly that are caused by unsequenced regions. These tools can be critical for improving the continuity of draft assemblies.

## Conclusion

Quality assessment is a critical step in the genome assembly process. It ensures that the assembled genome is accurate, complete, and reliable for downstream analyses. By utilizing a variety of metrics and specialized tools such as **QUAST**, **BUSCO**, and **CheckM**, researchers can ensure that their genome assemblies are of high quality and are suitable for various biological analyses.

Effective quality assessment leads to better decisions about assembly refinement, error correction, and the selection of appropriate tools and methods for genome assembly. Ultimately, it helps ensure that the final assembly accurately reflects the organism's genome and can be used confidently in scientific research.
