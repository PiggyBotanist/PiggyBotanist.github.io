# What is De Novo Assembly?

**De novo assembly** refers to the process of assembling short DNA or RNA sequence reads into longer contiguous sequences (contigs) without the need for a reference genome. This is particularly useful for sequencing novel genomes or species for which no prior reference sequences are available. The challenge in de novo assembly is to accurately piece together millions of short reads into a coherent and complete sequence.

### Key Features of De Novo Assembly
- **No Reference Genome**: Unlike reference-based assembly, de novo assembly does not rely on a known reference genome. Instead, the algorithm attempts to reconstruct the full genome from scratch.
- **Reconstruction from Short Reads**: De novo assembly algorithms use overlapping short reads to build contigs. These reads may come from various sequencing platforms like Illumina, PacBio, or Oxford Nanopore.
- **Complexity**: Assembling long, complex genomes without a reference is computationally expensive and challenging, particularly when the genome is large or contains repetitive regions.

## Steps in De Novo Assembly

De novo assembly typically involves several major steps:

### 1. **Preprocessing and Quality Control**
Before assembly begins, it is essential to preprocess the raw sequencing data:
- **Read trimming**: Remove low-quality sequences, adapter contamination, and short reads.
- **Error correction**: Correct sequencing errors (such as single nucleotide polymorphisms or indels) that might result from the sequencing process.
- **Read normalization**: Reduce the effect of overrepresented reads, especially in high-coverage datasets.

### 2. **Read Overlap**
The next step is identifying and aligning overlapping sequences from short reads to form longer contigs. Algorithms look for shared regions between adjacent reads and merge them to create continuous sequences.

### 3. **Contig Construction**
After identifying overlaps, the short reads are grouped into longer contiguous sequences (contigs). These contigs may range from hundreds to thousands of base pairs in length, depending on the sequencing technology and the assembly algorithm.

### 4. **Scaffolding**
In this step, contigs are further arranged and ordered into scaffolds using paired-end reads or long-read sequencing technology. Paired-end reads help bridge gaps between contigs and improve the overall assembly.

### 5. **Polishing**
Polishing refines the contigs and scaffolds by correcting small errors in the assembly. This step is often done using additional reads or long reads (e.g., from PacBio or Oxford Nanopore sequencing) to improve the accuracy of the final assembly.

## Algorithms for De Novo Assembly

Several algorithms have been developed for de novo assembly. These algorithms vary in their approaches and performance characteristics. Some key algorithms used in de novo assembly include:

### 1. **Overlap-Layout-Consensus (OLC)**
The **OLC** approach is one of the earliest and most common methods for de novo assembly. The basic steps in this algorithm are:
- **Overlap**: Identify overlapping regions between reads.
- **Layout**: Construct a layout where the reads are arranged based on their overlaps.
- **Consensus**: Generate a consensus sequence from the layout to create contigs.

The OLC algorithm is particularly suited for long-read data, such as PacBio or Oxford Nanopore, due to the ability of long reads to cover large genomic regions and provide good overlap.

### 2. **De Bruijn Graph**
In this approach, sequences are broken down into smaller k-mers (subsequences of length **k**), and a graph is constructed where each vertex represents a k-mer. The edges between vertices represent the overlap between adjacent k-mers in the reads. The graph is then traversed to form contigs.

De Bruijn graphs are particularly useful for short-read data (e.g., Illumina sequencing), as short reads can generate a vast number of k-mers that can be efficiently assembled.

#### Key Steps in De Bruijn Graph Assembly:
- **K-mer extraction**: Identify all k-mers (subsequences of length k) from the raw reads.
- **Graph construction**: Build a directed graph where each edge represents an overlap between two k-mers.
- **Path reconstruction**: Trace paths through the graph to generate contigs.

The main advantage of De Bruijn graphs is that they handle repetitive regions and large genomic datasets more effectively than traditional OLC methods.

### 3. **Greedy Algorithms**
Greedy algorithms work by iteratively finding the best overlap between reads and joining them to form contigs. This approach is simple but may not always provide the best results when dealing with complex genomes or high levels of sequencing errors.
