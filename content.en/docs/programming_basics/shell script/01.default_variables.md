# Common default variables:
- **$0:** The name of the script.
- **$1, $2, ...:** The positional parameters passed to the script (the arguments provided when running the script).
- **$#:** The number of arguments passed to the script.
- **$?:** The exit status of the last command run. A value of 0 indicates success, and non-zero indicates failure.
- **$@:** All the arguments passed to the script as separate words (quoted, meaning it can be used safely even if there are spaces in the arguments).
- **$*:** All the arguments passed to the script as a single word (unquoted, meaning it treats the arguments as a single string).
- **$$:** The process ID (PID) of the current script or shell.
- **$!:** The process ID of the last background command.
- **$_:** The last argument of the previous command.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Try running: "./<this_file> a b c"
echo "Script name: $0"
echo "Process ID: $$"
echo "Arguments given: $1 $2 $3"
echo "Number of arguments given: $#"
```
