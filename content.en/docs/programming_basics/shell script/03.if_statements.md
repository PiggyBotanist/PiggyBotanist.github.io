# Defining Variables in Shell Script

Structure:
```bash
if [condition]; then
    # Situation 1
elif [condition]; then
    # Situation 2
else
    # Default Situation
fi
```

Operators:
- &&: and
- ||: or
- !: not
- -eq: equal
- -ne: not equal
- -lt: less than
- -le: less than or equal to
- -gt: greater than
- -ge: greater than or equal to
Also accepted (but no <= or >= ... etc):
- ==: equal
- !=: not equal
- <: less than
- >: greater than

Example:
```bash
number=10
string="hello"

if [ $number -gt 10 ]; then
  echo "Number is greater than 10"
elif [ $number -gt 5 ]; then
  echo "Number is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10"
else
  echo "Number is 5 or less"
fi
```
Note for regex/wildcard pattern matchines we can use [[condition]] instead of [condition]
