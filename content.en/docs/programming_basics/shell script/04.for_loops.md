# Defining For Loops and While Loops

```bash
# Loop through array (value1 -> value2 -> value3)
for item in value1 value2 value3; do
  echo "Item: $item"
done

# Loop through numbers (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5)
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Number: $i"
done

# Loop through numbers {<start>..<end>..<increment/decrement>}
for i in {20..2..-1}; do
  echo "Odd number: $i"
done

# Loop through numbers $(seq <start> <increment/decrement> <end>)
for i in $(seq 1 2 10); do
  echo "Number: $i"
done

# Loop through files and folders in the directory
for file in /path/to/directory/*; do
  echo "File: $file"
done

# Loop through numbers (this is more similar to java)
for ((i=1; i<=5; i++)); do
  echo "Number: $i"
done

# Loop thorugh files/folders listed (the command can be customized here)
for file in $(ls); do
  echo "File: $file"
done

# While loop
while [ $counter -le 5 ]; do
  echo "Counter is $counter"
  ((counter++))  # Increment the counter by 1
done
```
