# Welcome to My Wesbsite:
Thank you for visiting my website! Feel free to explore ~

My name is **Piggy Botanist**, you can treat this website as my porfolio, but also a place for education content in **biology**, **computer science**, and **bioinformatics**.

If you have any questions about any specific topic related to *biology* or *computer science* feel free to reach outâ€”I'm more than happy to chat and will do my best to help with anything I can !

## More About this Website:
To my knowledge there are currently no well documented website that systematically teaches people research oriented *biology* and *bioinformatics*. So, here is the website!

**Current Available Topics**:
- [Bioinformatics](https://github.com/PiggyBotanist)
- [Biotechnologies](https://github.com/PiggyBotanist)
- [Microbiology](https://github.com/PiggyBotanist)
- [Pharmacology](https://github.com/PiggyBotanist)

All content created will be written by myself. 

If at any point I used *chatGPT* or other people's resource, I will state that explicitly. 

Publication will also be cited using **APA format** at the bottom of each content page

## How to access resource:
There is a **search** bar to the left. If you want to learn about specific topics, just type in the keyword:

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/images/others/search_bar.png" alt="Image for search bar" style="width: 300px;" />
</div>

In the case where a code is shown, it will be code format like this:
```python
# example python code:
print("hello world!")
```
There is also a table of content to the right that brings to directly to that specific section in that page.
