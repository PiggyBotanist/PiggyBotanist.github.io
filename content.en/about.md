# About Piggy Botanist:
My name is **Jeremy Chang**, but you can call me Piggy Botanist.

I earned my **Bachelor of Science (BSc)** with a major in *Biomedical Science* and a **Master's degree (MSc)** specializing in *Animal Science and Microbiology* at the University of Guelph, where I studied from 2018 to 2023. I am currently pursuing a **PhD** in the *Department of Computer Science at McGill University*.

I consider myself neither a complete biologist nor a full-fledged computer scientist; rather, I embody a unique intersection of both fields. This interdisciplinary background has granted me valuable experience in biological experiments within a *wet lab* environment, as well as in a traditional computer science lab focused on *algorithm development*, *machine learning models*, and *software implementations*. These experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in **bioinformatics**, allowing me to bridge the gap between biology and computer science.

Due to confidentiality, I cannot completely disclose my research project, but I am working on improving the process of metagenomics binning by utilize crowd-sourcing data in the training of AI agent. We hope to develop a bioinformatics analysis pipeline that enables the reconstruction of **metagenomics assembled genome (MAG)** for bacteria, fungi, protists, and virus from metagenomics samples collected from different enviornments which can include soil, fecal samples, fresh water, and environmental swabs.
