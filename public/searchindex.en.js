    "content": "Microbiology is the scientific study of microorganisms — tiny, often invisible organisms that play crucial roles in health, the environment, and various industrial processes. Microbiology can be broadly divided into several specialized fields, each focusing on different types of microorganisms:\nBacteriology: The study of bacteria, which are single-celled organisms that can exist independently or as pathogens, causing infections in humans, animals, and plants. Mycology: The study of fungi, which include yeasts, molds, and mushrooms. Fungi can be beneficial (e.g., in food production) but also harmful (e.g., causing infections). Virology: The study of viruses, which are non-living entities that require a host cell to reproduce and can cause a variety of diseases. 4 Parasitology: The study of parasites, organisms that live on or inside another organism (the host) and can cause diseases. Although viruses and parasites are technically not classified as microorganisms in the traditional sense, they are commonly included within the broader field of medical microbiology due to their significant clinical impact.\nWhile Immunology (the study of the immune system) and Protistology (the study of protists) are important fields that often intersect with microbiology, they will not be covered in detail here. However, they are also integral to the study of microorganisms and disease.\nIn this section, we will focus on the microbiological topics that have direct clinical relevance, including their role in health, disease, and treatment strategies.\nTopics in Microbiology PrinciplesMicrobiology Fundementals\nBacteriologyThis is a new chapter.\nMycologyThis is a new chapter.\nVirologyThis is a new chapter.\nParasitologyThis is a new chapter.",
