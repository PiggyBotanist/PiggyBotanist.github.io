      <description>Node Arrangement: Random Nodes Circular Nodes Number of Nodes (Recommended: 2 - 1000): Population Size (Recommend: 10 - 500): Generations (Recommend: 100 - 5,000): Mutation Rate (Recommend: 0.01 - 0.5): Run Pause Restart Introduction to Genetic Algorithm Genetic Algorithms (GA) is first proposed by John Holland in 1975, is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection in biology and belongs to a large class of algorithms known as evolutionary algorithms (EA) (Holland, 1975).&#xA;The algorithm mimics the process of nature selection, fitness, offspring production, and mutation. With repetition in these process over many generations, we will eventually arrive at a solution that is better and better overtime.</description>
