      <description>Biography: I am a passionate bioinformatician who enjoys studying and designing complex computer algorithms and models to solve complicated biological problems that can provide innovative solution to challenges in medicine. The complex nature in biology and the power of computer science makes the field of computational biology a fascinating field of study for me.&#xA;I was formally trained as a feed microbiologist at the University of Guelph first with a Bachelor of Science - Honours (BScH) concentrated in biomedical science in 2022 then a Masterâ€™s degree (MSc) specialized in animal nutrition and microbiology in 2024. After my MSc degree I when on to pursuit my PhD degree at Mcgill University with a concentration in bioinformatics and computer science since 2024.</description>
