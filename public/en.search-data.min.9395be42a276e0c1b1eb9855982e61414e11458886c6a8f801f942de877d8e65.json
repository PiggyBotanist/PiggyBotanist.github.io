This tutorial will explore key milestones and developments in the history of pharmacology.\nAncient Practices\r#\rPharmacology can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where herbal remedies were used to treat various ailments. Early records from ancient Egypt, China, and India describe the use of plants and minerals in medicinal preparations. The Ebers Papyrus (circa 1550 BCE) from Egypt is one of the oldest medical texts, listing numerous remedies derived from plants.\nThe Greeks and Romans\r#\rThe Greeks made significant contributions to the field, with philosophers such as Hippocrates (circa 460–370 BCE) emphasizing the importance of observing the effects of substances on the human body. Galen (circa 129–216 CE), a Roman physician, further advanced pharmacology by conducting experiments and establishing principles of drug action based on the four humors theory.\nThe Middle Ages\r#\rDuring the Middle Ages, the study of pharmacology stagnated in Europe but flourished in the Islamic world. Scholars like Avicenna (Ibn Sina) wrote influential texts, such as \u0026ldquo;The Canon of Medicine,\u0026rdquo; which compiled knowledge on herbs and drugs and emphasized the importance of empirical observation.\nThe Renaissance\r#\rThe Renaissance sparked renewed interest in science and medicine, leading to the establishment of botanical gardens and the systematic study of plants for medicinal purposes. Paracelsus (1493–1541) revolutionized pharmacology by advocating the use of chemicals in medicine and emphasizing the concept of dose-response.\nThe 18th and 19th Centuries\r#\rThe 18th century saw the emergence of modern chemistry, paving the way for the isolation of active ingredients from plants. In the 19th century, the discovery of morphine (from opium) and quinine (from cinchona bark) marked significant advancements in the understanding of drug actions and their therapeutic uses.\nThe 20th Century and Beyond\r#\rThe 20th century witnessed explosive growth in pharmacology, driven by advancements in biochemistry and molecular biology. The development of synthetic drugs, antibiotics, and vaccines transformed medicine. Regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, were established to ensure drug safety and efficacy.\nToday, pharmacology continues to evolve with innovations in pharmacogenomics, biotechnology, and personalized medicine, offering new insights into drug actions and individual responses to treatment.\nConclusion\r#\rThe history of pharmacology is a testament to humanity\u0026rsquo;s enduring quest for knowledge and healing.

These are often purified from natural sources and through the study of such compounds, more efficacious synthetic forms are created.\nIn general, sources of modern medicine can be divided into:\nNatural Derivatives Semi-Synthetic Synthetic Natural Source of Medication\r#\rPlant Derivatives\r#\rThe use of medicinal plants can date back to ancient Sumeria (3,000 BC), where hundreds of medicinal plants are listed on clay tablets. Although ancient people didn\u0026rsquo;t understand the mechanisms behind them, our ancestors learned to use these plants for curing diseases.\nSince the 19th century, active compounds in these plants have been constantly discovered and purified to create what we now know as medicine. Some well-known plant-derived drugs include:\nMorphine: derived from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum), used as a pain reliever. Aspirin: originally derived from willow bark, used as a pain reliever and anti-inflammatory agent. Quinine: derived from the bark of the cinchona tree, used to treat malaria. Digitalis: derived from the foxglove plant, used to treat heart conditions. Animal Derivatives\r#\rWith advancements in modern medicine and an understanding of physiology, some well-understood compounds derived from animals are also used as medication. For example:\nInsulin: originally extracted from the pancreas of pigs and cows, used to treat diabetes. Heparin: derived from the mucosal tissues of pigs and cows, used as an anticoagulant. Conotoxins: derived from the venom of cone snails, used as pain relievers and in neurological research. Microorganism-Derived Drugs\r#\rStudies of microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and algae have also allowed us to identify a variety of bioactive compounds, mostly for the use of antibiotics. Examples include:\nPenicillin: derived from the fungus Penicillium, used as an antibiotic. Streptomycin: derived from the bacterium Streptomyces, used as an antibiotic. Cyclosporine: derived from a fungus found in Norwegian soil, used as an immunosuppressant. Artemisinin: derived from the sweet wormwood plant, used as an antimalarial. Semi-Synthetic Compounds\r#\rSome drugs are derived from natural sources but undergo chemical modification to improve their properties. Examples include:\nMorphine derivatives: such as codeine and oxycodone, which are semi-synthetic opioids used as pain relievers. Penicillin derivatives: such as amoxicillin and ampicillin, which are semi-synthetic antibiotics derived from the natural compound penicillin. Statins: such as lovastatin and atorvastatin, which are semi-synthetic cholesterol-lowering drugs derived from natural compounds found in fungi. Synthetic Compounds\r#\rMany drugs are synthesized through chemical reactions in laboratories. Examples include:\nAcetaminophen (paracetamol): used as a pain reliever and fever reducer. Albuterol: used as a bronchodilator to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Simvastatin: used to lower cholesterol levels in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Metformin: used to treat type 2 diabetes by lowering blood sugar levels.

Pain relievers, antacids, allergy medications. Prescription Drugs Available only with a prescription from a licensed healthcare professional. Antibiotics, antidepressants, opioids. Illegal Drugs Prohibited by law for recreational use, sale, or possession. Heroin, LSD, marijuana (in some jurisdictions). OTC Drugs\r#\rDrugs labeled as OTC are generally used for common ailments, chronic conditions, preventive care, first aid, and dietary supplements.\nCurrent Use\r#\rCommon Ailments: OTC drugs are commonly used to alleviate symptoms of minor ailments such as headaches, colds, coughs, allergies, and indigestion. Common examples include acetaminophen (Tylenol®), ibuprofen (Advil®), and aspirin.\nChronic Conditions: Some OTC drugs are also used for managing chronic conditions like acid reflux, joint pain, and allergies, providing relief for recurring symptoms. Examples include loratadine (Claritin®) and cetirizine (Zyrtec®) for allergies, as well as bismuth (Pepto-Bismol®) for acid reflux.\nPreventive Care: Certain OTC drugs, such as multivitamins, supplements, and contraceptives, are used for preventive care, helping individuals maintain their health and well-being.\nFirst Aid: OTC drugs like pain relievers, antiseptics, and adhesive bandages are essential components of first-aid kits, used to treat minor injuries and wounds.\nDietary Supplements: Many people use OTC dietary supplements to complement their diets, aiming to address nutritional deficiencies or support specific health goals.\nOTC drugs provide convenient access to medications, allowing individuals to quickly address minor health concerns without the need for a prescription or a visit to a healthcare provider. However, due to their accessibility and cost-effectiveness, misuse and addiction have become major concerns for OTCs, as described by Schifano et al., 2021. According to the review, misuse most often occurs in patients already suffering from health conditions or psychiatric disorders, with cough mixtures containing dextromethorphan (DXM), codeine, and nasal decongestants containing pseudoephedrine being common sources of misuse.\nIt is also important to note that these medications can still have side effects, even though they are generally considered safe. For example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen or aspirin can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, or gastrointestinal bleeding, especially with long-term or high-dose use.\nPrescriptions\r#\rPrescription drugs are typically more potent and specialized but may also be more harmful or addictive than over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. In North America, ℞, usually printed as \u0026ldquo;Rx,\u0026rdquo; is used as an abbreviation for the word \u0026ldquo;prescription.\u0026rdquo; Therefore, a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider, such as a physician, nurse practitioner, or dentist, is required. These medications are regulated by government agencies to ensure their safety, efficacy, and proper use.\nA major concern in this class of drugs is antibiotic resistance, which refers to the ability of pathogens (organisms that we want to kill) to gain resistance through the misuse or overuse of antibiotics. The exact mechanisms behind antibiotic resistance are complex, and we will discuss it later in this tutorial. In general, to reduce antibiotic resistance, it is important for patients to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed.\nIllegal Drugs\r#\rIllegal drugs are often highly addictive and harmful to the body and are not commonly used for the treatment of diseases due to their side effects greatly outweighing their benefits. The definition and list of illegal drugs vary between countries, and some drugs classified as illegal may actually be available by prescription in others. Common illegal drugs include 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), and phencyclidine (PCP).\nPharmacopeia Websites\r#\rPharmacopeia refers to an official publication containing a list of medicinal drugs with their effects and directions for their use. Depending on the country, pharmacopeia can be found on different government websites:\nCountry Pharmacopeia United States United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Europe European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.)

But don\u0026rsquo;t panic; they won\u0026rsquo;t be so hard to understand.\nJust like the skin that separates our internal organs from the external environment, the biological membrane is a layer of phospholipid bilayer that separates the content inside the cell from the content outside the cell.\nIn chemistry, there is a term called hydrophobic, which literally means \u0026ldquo;water-fearing,\u0026rdquo; and a term hydrophilic, which means \u0026ldquo;water-loving.\u0026rdquo; Interchangeably, lipophilic and lipophobic can also be used, and you guessed it, it literally means \u0026ldquo;lipid-loving\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;lipid-fearing.\u0026rdquo;\nPhospholipids are a type of amphipathic molecule (a molecule with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions) where one fatty acid from a triglyceride molecule is removed and replaced with a phosphate group (1 phosphate group, 2 fatty acids, and 1 glycerol).\nThe fluid mosaic model describes that these biological membranes are:\nSemi-permeable "},{"id":10,"href":"/docs/content/bioinformatics/sequence_assembly/4th-level/","title":"4th Level","section":"Sequence Assembly","content":"\r4th Level of Menu\r#\rCaesorum illa tu sentit micat vestes papyriferi\r#\rInde aderam facti; Theseus vis de tauri illa peream.
