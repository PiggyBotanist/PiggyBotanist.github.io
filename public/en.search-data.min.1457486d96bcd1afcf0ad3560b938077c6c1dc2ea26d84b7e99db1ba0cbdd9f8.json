It carries genetic information crucial for the growth, development, functioning, and reproduction of all living organisms. DNA is found in nearly every cell of an organism, housed in the cell\u0026rsquo;s nucleus (in eukaryotes) or in the cytoplasm (in prokaryotes). In humans, DNA is located in the chromosomes within the nucleus.\nThe Structure of DNA\r#\rDNA is a long molecule made up of subunits called nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of three components:\nA phosphate group. A sugar molecule (specifically, deoxyribose in the case of DNA). A nitrogenous base. There are four types of nitrogenous bases: Adenine (A) Thymine (T) Cytosine (C) Guanine (G) These nucleotides link together to form long chains, with each chain consisting of a sugar-phosphate backbone. The four nitrogenous bases pair up in a very specific way to form the \u0026ldquo;steps\u0026rdquo; of the DNA double helix:\nAdenine (A) always pairs with Thymine (T). Cytosine (C) always pairs with Guanine (G). This pairing of bases, known as base pairing, is crucial for the formation of the double helix structure and for accurate DNA replication.\nDouble Helix\r#\rThe classic structure of DNA is a double helix — two long strands of nucleotides twisted around each other. The two strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between the complementary bases, A-T and C-G. This structure was first described by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962, along with Maurice Wilkins.\nThe Function of DNA\r#\rDNA serves as the genetic blueprint for all living organisms, providing the instructions for building proteins, which are responsible for carrying out most of the functions within a cell. Here\u0026rsquo;s how DNA\u0026rsquo;s information is used:\n1. Genetic Information Storage\r#\rDNA stores the instructions for the cell to make proteins. These instructions are written in the form of genes, which are segments of DNA that encode specific proteins or RNA molecules.\n2. Replication\r#\rBefore a cell divides, it must first make an exact copy of its DNA so that each daughter cell receives a complete set of genetic information. The process of DNA replication ensures that the genetic information is accurately copied.\nHelicase unzips the double helix structure. DNA polymerase reads the existing strand and builds the new complementary strand by adding nucleotides. 3. Protein Synthesis\r#\rDNA is involved in protein synthesis through two main processes:\nTranscription: The process in which an RNA copy of a gene is made. Translation: The process in which the RNA is used as a template to build proteins. 4. Mutation and Variation\r#\rChanges in the DNA sequence (mutations) can occur due to various factors like environmental damage, errors during replication, or recombination. Mutations contribute to genetic variation, which is essential for evolution.\nThe Role of DNA in Heredity\r#\rDNA is responsible for heredity, the process by which genetic traits are passed from parents to offspring. The genetic material is inherited through the gametes (sperm and egg cells in humans), which contain half of the genetic material of the parents. When sperm fertilizes an egg, the resulting offspring inherits a combination of genes from both parents, resulting in a unique genetic profile.\nHumans have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs) in each somatic cell, with one set coming from the mother and the other from the father. These chromosomes contain the genes that code for various traits, from eye color to susceptibility to certain diseases.\nDNA and Genetic Diseases\r#\rCertain genetic diseases are caused by mutations in specific genes. For example:\nCystic fibrosis: Caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. Sickle cell anemia: Caused by a mutation in the HBB gene. Huntington\u0026rsquo;s disease: Caused by a mutation in the HTT gene. Genetic testing can identify mutations that lead to these and other genetic disorders, providing valuable information for diagnosis and treatment.\nDNA Sequencing\r#\rDNA sequencing is the process of determining the exact sequence of nucleotides in a DNA molecule. This can provide valuable insights into the genetic makeup of an organism and is essential for many modern biological research techniques, such as:\nGenome sequencing: Mapping out the entire DNA of an organism. Gene expression analysis: Understanding which genes are active under different conditions. Variant discovery: Identifying mutations in the genome. Advances in sequencing technology, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), have significantly reduced the cost and time required for sequencing, making it a routine part of genomic research and clinical diagnostics.\nApplications of DNA in Biotechnology\r#\rDNA plays a central role in biotechnology, where it is used for a variety of applications:\nGene cloning: Isolating and making copies of genes for study or therapeutic use. Genetic engineering: Modifying an organism’s genome to introduce desirable traits (e.g., genetically modified crops). Gene therapy: Introducing, removing, or altering genetic material within a person\u0026rsquo;s cells to treat or prevent disease. Forensic analysis: DNA profiling is used in criminal investigations to match suspects to crime scenes or to identify individuals in paternity testing. The Future of DNA Research\r#\rDNA research is constantly evolving. Some exciting areas of research include:\nCRISPR-Cas9 gene editing: A revolutionary tool that allows for precise modification of the DNA in living organisms. Synthetic biology: Creating synthetic DNA sequences or even entire synthetic organisms. Personalized medicine: Using an individual’s DNA to tailor medical treatments to their specific genetic makeup. Conclusion\r#\rDNA is the blueprint of life, storing the genetic information that defines an organism. From its structure as a double helix to its involvement in processes like replication, transcription, and translation, DNA is essential to all living organisms. Its role in inheritance and its potential for research and medicine make DNA a critical focus of modern biology and biotechnology.\nBy continuing to study and manipulate DNA, scientists can unlock even more secrets of life, leading to advancements in medicine, agriculture, and understanding the diversity of life on Earth.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/content/biotechnology/macromolecules/","title":"Macromolecules","section":"Biotechnology","content":"\rMacromolecules\r#\r"},{"id":6,"href":"/docs/content/pharmacology/","title":"Pharmacology","section":"Docs","content":"\rIntroduction to Pharmacology\r#\rTerminologies\r#\rTerms Description Pharmacokinetics The study of how the body affects a drug.

They are composed of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. Proteins perform a wide range of essential functions in living organisms, including catalyzing biochemical reactions (as enzymes), supporting cellular structures, and facilitating communication between cells.\nProteins are often referred to as the \u0026ldquo;molecular machines\u0026rdquo; of cells because they carry out most of the cell\u0026rsquo;s functions. The sequence and structure of a protein determine its function, making them highly specialized molecules.\nThe Structure of Proteins\r#\rProteins are made up of long chains of amino acids, and their structure is organized at four distinct levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.\n1. Primary Structure\r#\rThe primary structure of a protein is the sequence of amino acids that make up the polypeptide chain. The sequence of amino acids is determined by the gene encoding the protein, which is transcribed into mRNA and translated into a sequence of amino acids at the ribosome.\nThere are 20 different amino acids, each with a unique side chain (R group), and the order of these amino acids in the polypeptide chain defines the protein\u0026rsquo;s specific structure and function.\n2. Secondary Structure\r#\rThe secondary structure refers to the local folding patterns of the polypeptide chain that result from hydrogen bonds between the backbone atoms. The most common secondary structures are:\nAlpha helix: A right-handed spiral coil, stabilized by hydrogen bonds. Beta-pleated sheet: A zig-zag folding pattern, stabilized by hydrogen bonds between strands. These structures form regular patterns within the polypeptide chain and are critical for the overall shape of the protein.\n3. Tertiary Structure\r#\rThe tertiary structure is the three-dimensional shape of the entire polypeptide chain, including the arrangement of secondary structural elements. This structure is stabilized by various interactions, including:\nHydrophobic interactions: Non-polar side chains tend to cluster together in the interior of the protein, away from water. Hydrogen bonds: Between polar side chains and backbone atoms. Ionic bonds: Between positively and negatively charged side chains. Disulfide bridges: Covalent bonds between sulfur atoms in cysteine residues. The tertiary structure is crucial for the protein\u0026rsquo;s function, as it determines the active site of enzymes and the protein\u0026rsquo;s ability to bind to other molecules.\n4. Quaternary Structure\r#\rSome proteins are made up of multiple polypeptide chains, or subunits. The quaternary structure refers to the arrangement of these subunits into a functional protein complex. Hemoglobin, for example, is a tetramer, composed of four subunits that work together to carry oxygen in the blood.\nThe interactions between subunits in the quaternary structure are similar to those that stabilize the tertiary structure, including hydrophobic interactions, ionic bonds, and hydrogen bonds.\nThe Functions of Proteins\r#\rProteins are involved in nearly every aspect of cellular function. Some of the most important functions include:\n1. Enzyme Catalysis\r#\rOne of the most important roles of proteins is to act as enzymes, which catalyze biochemical reactions. Enzymes lower the activation energy required for reactions, making them occur more efficiently. Examples of enzyme functions include:\nDNA polymerase: Catalyzes the synthesis of DNA during cell division. Amylase: Breaks down starch into simpler sugars during digestion. Pepsin: Digests proteins in the stomach. 2. Structural Support\r#\rProteins also provide structural support to cells and tissues. These structural proteins form the scaffolding that maintains the shape of cells and organs. Examples include:\nCollagen: The main structural protein in the extracellular matrix of connective tissues, such as tendons and skin. Keratin: Found in hair, nails, and skin, providing mechanical strength. Actin and Tubulin: Form the cytoskeleton of the cell, providing structure and enabling movement. 3. Transport\r#\rMany proteins are involved in the transport of molecules across cell membranes or within the bloodstream. These proteins ensure that vital molecules reach their proper destinations in the body. Examples include:\nHemoglobin: A protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to tissues and returns carbon dioxide from tissues to the lungs. Ion channels: Proteins embedded in the cell membrane that allow specific ions (such as sodium, potassium, or calcium) to pass through and help maintain cellular homeostasis. 4. Cell Signaling\r#\rProteins also play key roles in cell signaling—the process by which cells communicate with each other and respond to environmental cues. These proteins include:\nReceptors: Proteins on the cell surface or inside the cell that bind to signaling molecules (such as hormones or neurotransmitters), initiating a cellular response. An example is the insulin receptor, which helps regulate glucose levels. G proteins: Act as intermediaries in signaling pathways, transmitting signals from receptors on the cell surface to intracellular target proteins. 5. Immune Response\r#\rProteins are crucial in the body\u0026rsquo;s defense mechanisms against pathogens. These proteins include:\nAntibodies: Proteins produced by the immune system that recognize and neutralize foreign invaders, such as bacteria and viruses. Cytokines: Small proteins involved in cell signaling during immune responses, including inflammation and infection. 6. Gene Regulation\r#\rProteins also play a significant role in regulating gene expression. These regulatory proteins include:\nTranscription factors: Proteins that bind to DNA to either promote or inhibit the transcription of specific genes. Histones: Proteins that help package DNA into nucleosomes and regulate gene accessibility by influencing the structure of chromatin. Protein Synthesis: From DNA to Protein\r#\rThe process of synthesizing proteins from genetic information encoded in DNA involves two major steps: transcription and translation.\n1. Transcription\r#\rIn the nucleus, the information in a gene (a segment of DNA) is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) by the enzyme RNA polymerase. This mRNA serves as a copy of the gene\u0026rsquo;s information, which can be translated into a protein.\n2. Translation\r#\rThe mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, where it is read by ribosomes. The ribosome reads the mRNA sequence in sets of three nucleotides, known as codons, and assembles the corresponding amino acids into a growing polypeptide chain. tRNA molecules bring the correct amino acids to the ribosome, matching the mRNA codons with their corresponding amino acids.\nOnce the polypeptide chain is complete, it undergoes folding into its final three-dimensional structure, often assisted by chaperone proteins. This functional protein is now ready to carry out its specific task in the cell.\nProteins and Disease\r#\rDysfunctions or mutations in proteins are responsible for many diseases. Some common examples include:\nCystic fibrosis: Caused by a mutation in the CFTR protein that disrupts ion transport in cells, leading to thick mucus buildup in the lungs and other organs. Sickle cell anemia: Caused by a mutation in the hemoglobin protein, leading to the formation of abnormal red blood cells. Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease: Associated with the accumulation of misfolded amyloid beta proteins that form plaques in the brain. Cancer: Involves mutations in proteins that regulate cell growth and division, such as tumor suppressors (e.g., p53) and oncogenes. Protein Engineering\r#\rProtein engineering is a field of biotechnology that involves designing and modifying proteins for specific applications. This can include improving enzyme efficiency for industrial processes, developing therapeutic proteins, or creating antibodies for disease treatment. Key techniques in protein engineering include:\nSite-directed mutagenesis: Introducing specific mutations into a protein to alter its properties. Protein design: Using computational tools to design novel proteins with desired functions. Directed evolution: Mimicking natural evolution in the laboratory to improve proteins for specific tasks. Conclusion\r#\rProteins are fundamental molecules that support nearly all biological processes, from metabolism to immune response. Their diverse structures allow them to carry out a wide variety of tasks within the cell, making them indispensable for life. Understanding protein structure and function is essential for advancing fields such as biotechnology, medicine, and genetics.\nThe study of proteins continues to be a central focus in molecular biology and biomedical research, with potential applications ranging from drug development to disease treatment and beyond.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/docs/content/bioinformatics/sequence_assembly/","title":"Sequence Assembly","section":"Bioinformatics","content":"\rWhat is Sequence Assembly?\r#\rIntroduction to DNA\r#\rBefore we talk about what Sequence Assembly is, we will need to understand what DNA is.\nDNA which is short for Deoxy-ribonucleic Acid. DNA is the genetic cotent that help all living organisms on Earth produce machinaries to survive. They can be passd on\nWe have more information about DNA here\nSequence Assembly in short is a method that reconstructs longer genetic information from small fragments.\nThis defintion might\nSequence asssembly is one of the most fundamental process in bioinformatics.\nIn modern\n#\rDNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is the fundamental molecule that carries the genetic instructions for the development, functioning, and reproduction of all living organisms. It encodes the blueprint for life in sequences of four chemical bases—adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G).\nDue to the fragmented nature of modern DNA sequencing technologies\nSequence assembly is a fundamental process in bioinformatics that involves reconstructing longer DNA sequences from smaller fragments, often called reads. This process is essential for determining the genome structure of organisms, understanding genetic variation, and conducting various genomics studies. By piecing together these fragments, sequence assembly provides a comprehensive view of an organism\u0026rsquo;s genetic makeup, even when individual DNA strands are too short to be read directly.\nThe primary challenge in sequence assembly arises from the fact that the sequencing technologies used today generate short reads, often ranging from 100 to 500 base pairs. These short fragments need to be aligned and merged to form a continuous, accurate sequence. This process is crucial for various applications, including whole genome sequencing, transcriptome analysis, and metagenomic studies.\nTypes of Sequence Assembly\r#\rThere are two main approaches to sequence assembly: de novo assembly and reference-guided assembly.\n1. De Novo Assembly\r#\rDe novo assembly is the process of assembling the sequence without any prior knowledge of the organism\u0026rsquo;s genome. This method is particularly useful when studying novel or poorly characterized organisms. In de novo assembly, the assembler must align the short fragments (or reads) to build longer sequences (contigs). The process often requires sophisticated algorithms to deal with repetitive DNA sequences and ensure the assembly is accurate and complete.\nKey Steps in De Novo Assembly:\r#\rRead Alignment: Aligning the short reads to identify overlaps. Contig Construction: Combining overlapping reads to create contiguous sequences (contigs). Scaffolding: Linking contigs together to form larger structures, known as scaffolds. Polishing: Refining the assembly by correcting errors and filling gaps. 2. Reference-Guided Assembly\r#\rReference-guided assembly, also known as mapping-based assembly, involves aligning the short reads to a reference genome. This method is typically faster and more accurate than de novo assembly, as it leverages existing genomic information to guide the assembly process. It\u0026rsquo;s commonly used in applications such as resequencing, where the goal is to study an organism\u0026rsquo;s genome in relation to a known reference genome.\nKey Steps in Reference-Guided Assembly:\r#\rRead Alignment: Mapping the reads to the reference genome. Error Correction: Identifying and correcting discrepancies between the reads and the reference. Variant Calling: Detecting genetic variations (e.g., SNPs, indels) compared to the reference. Importance of Sequence Assembly\r#\rSequence assembly is crucial for several areas of biological research, including:\nGenomics: It enables the complete sequencing of genomes, providing insight into genetic diversity and evolution. Metagenomics: In microbial community studies, sequence assembly is used to reconstruct genomes from environmental samples, allowing researchers to explore the genetic makeup of complex microbial ecosystems. Cancer Genomics: Sequence assembly is vital for identifying mutations and structural variations that may be implicated in cancer. Personalized Medicine: By assembling the genomes of individuals, researchers can identify genetic variants that influence disease susceptibility and drug response. Tools and Algorithms for Sequence Assembly\r#\rThere are several software tools and algorithms designed for sequence assembly. These tools vary in terms of their approach, accuracy, and computational requirements. Some of the widely used tools include:\nSPAdes: A popular de novo assembler known for its high accuracy in assembling genomes. Velvet: Another de novo assembler that is highly efficient for assembling short reads. BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner): A widely used reference-guided assembler for mapping reads to a reference genome. Bowtie2: A fast and memory-efficient aligner used for mapping short reads to large genomes. Challenges in Sequence Assembly\r#\rDespite advancements in sequencing technology and computational methods, sequence assembly remains a complex and computationally intensive task. Some of the main challenges include:\n1. Repetitive Sequences\r#\rRepetitive regions of the genome can be difficult to assemble because short reads may map to multiple locations. This can result in gaps or misassemblies.\n2. Coverage Gaps\r#\rIn areas with low sequencing coverage, the assembly may be incomplete or contain errors. Ensuring sufficient coverage is essential for accurate assembly.\n3. Error Correction\r#\rSequencing errors, such as base miscalls or insertions/deletions, can introduce inaccuracies in the assembly. These errors must be carefully corrected to improve the quality of the assembled genome.\n4. Computational Requirements\r#\rThe process of assembling large genomes from millions of short reads can be computationally expensive, requiring substantial memory and processing power. Optimizing algorithms to handle large datasets efficiently is an ongoing challenge.\nFuture Directions\r#\rWith advances in next-generation sequencing technologies, such as long-read sequencing (e.g., PacBio and Oxford Nanopore), sequence assembly is expected to become more accurate and efficient. These technologies can generate much longer reads, reducing the complexity of the assembly process and improving the accuracy of contig assembly.\nAdditionally, machine learning and artificial intelligence are being explored to enhance the performance of sequence assembly tools, enabling faster and more accurate genome reconstruction.\nConclusion\r#\rSequence assembly is a cornerstone of modern genomics, enabling researchers to generate complete genome sequences from short DNA fragments. Whether through de novo or reference-guided assembly, this process provides critical insights into the genetic makeup of organisms. Although challenges remain, ongoing advancements in sequencing technology and computational methods continue to improve the efficiency and accuracy of sequence assembly, driving forward our understanding of biology and genetics.\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/docs/content/pharmacology/general_abbreviations/","title":"General_abbreviations","section":"Pharmacology","content":"\rCommon Abbreviations\r#\rCommon Abbreviations in Prescriptions\r#\rHave you ever wondered what the weird abbreviations like \u0026ldquo;p.o\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;p.e\u0026rdquo; mean?

Illegal Drugs Prohibited by law for recreational use, sale, or possession. Heroin, LSD, marijuana (in some jurisdictions). OTC Drugs\r#\rDrugs labeled as OTC are generally used for common ailments, chronic conditions, preventive care, first aid, and dietary supplements.\nCurrent Use\r#\rCommon Ailments: OTC drugs are commonly used to alleviate symptoms of minor ailments such as headaches, colds, coughs, allergies, and indigestion. Common examples include acetaminophen (Tylenol®), ibuprofen (Advil®), and aspirin.\nChronic Conditions: Some OTC drugs are also used for managing chronic conditions like acid reflux, joint pain, and allergies, providing relief for recurring symptoms. Examples include loratadine (Claritin®) and cetirizine (Zyrtec®) for allergies, as well as bismuth (Pepto-Bismol®) for acid reflux.\nPreventive Care: Certain OTC drugs, such as multivitamins, supplements, and contraceptives, are used for preventive care, helping individuals maintain their health and well-being.\nFirst Aid: OTC drugs like pain relievers, antiseptics, and adhesive bandages are essential components of first-aid kits, used to treat minor injuries and wounds.\nDietary Supplements: Many people use OTC dietary supplements to complement their diets, aiming to address nutritional deficiencies or support specific health goals.\nOTC drugs provide convenient access to medications, allowing individuals to quickly address minor health concerns without the need for a prescription or a visit to a healthcare provider. However, due to their accessibility and cost-effectiveness, misuse and addiction have become major concerns for OTCs, as described by Schifano et al., 2021. According to the review, misuse most often occurs in patients already suffering from health conditions or psychiatric disorders, with cough mixtures containing dextromethorphan (DXM), codeine, and nasal decongestants containing pseudoephedrine being common sources of misuse.\nIt is also important to note that these medications can still have side effects, even though they are generally considered safe. For example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen or aspirin can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, or gastrointestinal bleeding, especially with long-term or high-dose use.\nPrescriptions\r#\rPrescription drugs are typically more potent and specialized but may also be more harmful or addictive than over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. In North America, ℞, usually printed as \u0026ldquo;Rx,\u0026rdquo; is used as an abbreviation for the word \u0026ldquo;prescription.\u0026rdquo; Therefore, a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider, such as a physician, nurse practitioner, or dentist, is required. These medications are regulated by government agencies to ensure their safety, efficacy, and proper use.\nA major concern in this class of drugs is antibiotic resistance, which refers to the ability of pathogens (organisms that we want to kill) to gain resistance through the misuse or overuse of antibiotics. The exact mechanisms behind antibiotic resistance are complex, and we will discuss it later in this tutorial. In general, to reduce antibiotic resistance, it is important for patients to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed.\nIllegal Drugs\r#\rIllegal drugs are often highly addictive and harmful to the body and are not commonly used for the treatment of diseases due to their side effects greatly outweighing their benefits. The definition and list of illegal drugs vary between countries, and some drugs classified as illegal may actually be available by prescription in others. Common illegal drugs include 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), and phencyclidine (PCP).\nPharmacopeia Websites\r#\rPharmacopeia refers to an official publication containing a list of medicinal drugs with their effects and directions for their use. Depending on the country, pharmacopeia can be found on different government websites:\nCountry Pharmacopeia United States United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Europe European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.)

Before we talk about each individually, there are a few fundamental concepts you should understand.\nThe Fluid Mosaic Model\r#\rWhen we talk about medications, it is really hard not to mention some fundamental concepts from cell biology and physiology. But don\u0026rsquo;t panic; they won\u0026rsquo;t be so hard to understand.\nJust like the skin that separates our internal organs from the external environment, the biological membrane is a layer of phospholipid bilayer that separates the content inside the cell from the content outside the cell.\nIn chemistry, there is a term called hydrophobic, which literally means \u0026ldquo;water-fearing,\u0026rdquo; and a term hydrophilic, which means \u0026ldquo;water-loving.\u0026rdquo; Interchangeably, lipophilic and lipophobic can also be used, and you guessed it, it literally means \u0026ldquo;lipid-loving\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;lipid-fearing.\u0026rdquo;\nPhospholipids are a type of amphipathic molecule (a molecule with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions) where one fatty acid from a triglyceride molecule is removed and replaced with a phosphate group (1 phosphate group, 2 fatty acids, and 1 glycerol).\nThe fluid mosaic model describes that these biological membranes are:\nSemi-permeable "},{"id":14,"href":"/about/","title":"About Piggy Botanist","section":"Welcome to My Website","content":"\rAbout Piggy Botanist:\r#\rMy name is Jeremy Chang, but you can call me Piggy Botanist.\nI earned my Bachelor of Science (BSc) with a major in Biomedical Science and a Master\u0026rsquo;s degree (MSc) specializing in Animal Science and Microbiology at the University of Guelph, where I studied from 2018 to 2023. I am currently pursuing a PhD in the Department of Computer Science at McGill University.\nI consider myself neither a complete biologist nor a full-fledged computer scientist; rather, I embody a unique intersection of both fields. This interdisciplinary background has granted me valuable experience in biological experiments within a wet lab environment, as well as in a traditional computer science lab focused on algorithm development, machine learning models, and software implementations. These experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in bioinformatics, allowing me to bridge the gap between biology and computer science.\nDue to confidentiality, I cannot completely disclose my research project, but I am working on improving the process of metagenomics binning by utilize crowd-sourcing data in the training of AI agent. We hope to develop a bioinformatics analysis pipeline that enables the reconstruction of metagenomics assembled genome (MAG) for bacteria, fungi, protists, and virus from metagenomics samples collected from different enviornments which can include soil, fecal samples, fresh water, and environmental swabs.\nExperience:\r#\rPublications:\r#\rQi, N., Zhan, X., Milmine, J., Chang, K.-H., \u0026amp; Li, J.
