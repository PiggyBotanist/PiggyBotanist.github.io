These are, in fact, common abbreviations used in prescriptions to help pharmacologists prepare the drugs and instructions you see when you get your medications.\nHere is a handy list of commonly used abbreviations. Note that these terms might or might not be used and will depend on how the professionals are trained:\nAbbreviation Description AA Of each (ana) AAU Both ears (auris utraque) AC Before meals (ante cibum) AM In the morning (ante meridiem) AD Right ear (auris dexter) AD US Up to (ad usque) AQ Water (aqua) AS Left ear (auris sinister) ATC Around the clock BB By mouth (per os) BID Twice a day (bis in die) BM Bowel movement (bucco-masseteric) C With (cum) CAPS Capsules CONC Concentrated DIL Dilute DIV Divide EC Enteric coated EOD Every other day FT Make, prepare (fac, fiat) GT Drops (guttae) H Hour (hora) HS At bedtime (hora somni) IN Intranasal (intra nasal) IM Intramuscular (intra muscular) IV Intravenous (intra venous) M Mix (misce) M ET N Half and half (misce et nota) MIXT Mixture NON REP Do not repeat (non repetatur) OD Once daily (omni die) OD Right eye (oculus dexter) OS Left eye (oculus sinister) OU Both eyes (oculi utroque) PC After meals (post cibum) PID Twice a day (post in die) PRN As needed (pro re nata) Q Every (quaque) QH Every hour (quaque hora) QHS Every night at bedtime (quaque hora somni) QID Four times a day (quater in die) SL Sublingual (sub lingual) SS One-half (semis) STAT Immediately (statim) TAB Tablet TID Three times a day (ter in die) "},{"id":1,"href":"/bioinformatics/general_introduction/","title":"General_introduction","section":"Bioinformatics","content":"\rIntroduction to Bioinformatics\r#\rDefinition of Bioinformatics\r#\rThe term \u0026ldquo;Bioinformatics,\u0026rdquo; first coined by Paulien Hogeweg and Ben Hesper in 1970, is now an interdisciplinary field that combines biology, computer science, mathematics, and statistics to analyze and interpret biological data such as DNA, RNA, and proteins.\n{:style=\u0026ldquo;max-width: 400px\u0026rdquo;}\nFigure: Venn Diagram of areas of studies\nWith computational power and deriving mathematical models, knowledge that would have taken traditional methods years to figure out can now be solved in months or even days.\nSubjects within Bioinformatics\r#\rWhile bioinformatics utilizes computational power and mathematics, their goal is to extrapolate precise, accurate predictions to help biologists understand the biological system. Whether it is to understand the mechanisms behind the causes of disease (etiology), developing drugs capable of killing certain pathogens, or making predictions about when and how a pandemic may occur.\nWhile there is only one goal in the study of bioinformatics, different answers require different approaches to answer. In modern bioinformatics, such studies can be further broken down into subdisciplines:\n01. Genomics 02. Epigenomics 03. Transcriptomics 04. Proteomics 05. Metabolomics 06. Metagenomics 07. Microbiomics 08. Phylogenetics 09. Structural Bioinformatics 10. Classification Epigenomics\r#\rEpigenomics investigates changes in gene expression or cellular phenotype that are heritable but do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence. This field includes the study of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin structure. Applications include understanding how epigenetic changes contribute to cancer development and other diseases.\nTranscriptomics\r#\rTranscriptomics focuses on the study of all RNA molecules (transcriptome) produced in a cell or tissue under specific conditions. It helps in understanding gene expression patterns, alternative splicing, and RNA editing. An example application is the identification of gene expression signatures associated with drug response or disease progression.\nProteomics\r#\rProteomics involves the study of the entire set of proteins (proteome) expressed in a cell, tissue, or organism. It includes protein identification, quantification, characterization of post-translational modifications, and protein-protein interactions. Applications range from biomarker discovery for disease diagnosis to understanding protein networks in cellular signaling.\nMetabolomics\r#\rMetabolomics focuses on the study of all small molecule metabolites (metabolome) present in a biological sample. It provides insights into cellular processes, biochemical pathways, and metabolic fluxes. Applications include identifying metabolic biomarkers for disease diagnosis and monitoring metabolic responses to drug treatments.\nMetagenomics\r#\rMetagenomics involves the study of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples, such as soil, water, or microbial communities. It enables the characterization of microbial diversity, functional potential, and ecological interactions. Applications include understanding microbial communities in the human gut and their roles in health and disease.\nMicrobiomics\r#\rMicrobiomics focuses on the study of microbial communities associated with humans, animals, plants, or environments. It includes the characterization of microbial diversity, interactions, and functional potential. Applications include understanding the role of the human microbiome in various diseases and developing microbiome-based therapies.\nPhylogenetics\r#\rPhylogenetics involves the study of evolutionary relationships among organisms based on genetic data. It helps in reconstructing evolutionary trees, understanding speciation events, and studying the evolution of traits. Applications include tracing the origins and spread of infectious diseases and identifying evolutionary relationships between species.\nStructural Bioinformatics\r#\rStructural bioinformatics focuses on the prediction and analysis of the three-dimensional structures of biological macromolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids. It helps in understanding protein function, drug design, and protein-ligand interactions. Applications include protein structure prediction and virtual screening of drug candidates.\nClassification\r#\rClassification involves the development and application of computational models to classify biological data into distinct groups or categories. It includes machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines and neural networks, for pattern recognition and predictive modeling. Applications range from predicting protein functions to classifying cancer subtypes based on gene expression profiles.\nBrief History\r#\r"}]
