# R 101

R is a programming language designed to perform statistics, data visualization,
and machine learning. R was created in 1993. It is an open source project and 
is free to download and use without any restrictions. 

R is used in many different fields including:

* Data science
* Information science  
* Bioinformatics
* Business analytics
* and more!

## RStudio 

RStudio is a sophisticated code editor for the R programming language. View
the [quick start]({{ site.baseurl }}/quickstart.html) guide to learn how to 
install R and RStudio.

By default, RStudio has a four panel layout as depicted below.

* **Source:** this panel is where you write your R scripts. Any code that you want
    to save for later goes here. Think about it like a Word document for your
    R code.
* **Console/Terminal:** this panel is where you can execute R code that you
    don't need to save for later. This is useful for installing packages or other
    one time activates. You can type code in the console and hit enter to execute
    your command.
* **Environment/History:** this panel shows you what variables and other objects
    you have loaded into memory. More simply, it tells you what data you're 
    currently working with.
* **Files/Plots/Packages/Help:** this panel contains a lot of other information
    including what packages you have installed, any plots you have created, and
    a help menu to read documentation.

This is the default layout of RStudio. You can change it in the Global Settings
to arrange the panels in anyway you'd like.

## Basic Syntax

R has a simple and easy to learn syntax. It was designed to be accessible to 
non-programmers and researchers. First we will start with some basic math
functions.

```
# Anything that begins with a hashtag is a comment
# This allows you to add notes to your program 

1 + 1    # Addition
2 - 1    # Subtraction
5 * 1    # Multipliation
25 / 5   # Division
5^2      # Exponents
```
If you want to save the output of an operation for later use, you can store
it in a variable. The assignment operator in R is `<-`. You can name variables
whatever you like, but there are a few rules. 

* Variables cannot contain spaces
* Variables cannot start with numbers or only contain numbers
* Variables cannot contain special characters ($,^,&, etc.)

|Bad|Good|
|---|---|
|my data| my\_data |
|25model | model25 | 
| group1&group2 | group1\_and\_group2|

Variable names should be short but descriptive. Other people should be able to
read your code and understand what's going on. 

```
# We want to store '5+5' for later use
result<-5+5

# We can also store other datatypes like a string
full_name<-"Jane Doe"

# We can store lists of things
class_members<-c("John Doe","Jane Doe","Jim Smith")
```
## Installing and Loading Packages

Over the years, the R community has created many additional features.  These 
features are bundled together in packages. Packages can be installed easily 
using the `install.packages` function. 

Suppose we wanted to install `ggplot2` (a package that allows you to build 
nice looking graphs). In the R console, type out the following command 
and press enter.

```
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

This will download the package from the internet and install the it on your 
computer. Then, whenever you want to use it in an R script, you can you can load 
it into your environment using the `library` function. Suppose we wanted to load
`ggplot2`. We could write the following command.

```
library(ggplot2)
```
