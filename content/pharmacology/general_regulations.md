# Classification of Drugs By Law

## Drug Classification

In general, drugs used in healthcare can be classified into four groups by law, including Over-the-Counter (OTC) drugs, prescription drugs, and illegal drugs, ranked from low to high regulation levels.

| Class                          | Legal Status                                                | Examples                                       |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drugs** | Available for purchase without a prescription.            | Pain relievers, antacids, allergy medications. |
| **Prescription Drugs**         | Available only with a prescription from a licensed healthcare professional. | Antibiotics, antidepressants, opioids.         |
| **Illegal Drugs**              | Prohibited by law for recreational use, sale, or possession. | Heroin, LSD, marijuana (in some jurisdictions). |

## OTC Drugs

Drugs labeled as OTC are generally used for common ailments, chronic conditions, preventive care, first aid, and dietary supplements. 

### Current Use

**Common Ailments:** OTC drugs are commonly used to alleviate symptoms of minor ailments such as headaches, colds, coughs, allergies, and indigestion. Common examples include acetaminophen (Tylenol®), ibuprofen (Advil®), and aspirin.

**Chronic Conditions:** Some OTC drugs are also used for managing chronic conditions like acid reflux, joint pain, and allergies, providing relief for recurring symptoms. Examples include loratadine (Claritin®) and cetirizine (Zyrtec®) for allergies, as well as bismuth (Pepto-Bismol®) for acid reflux.

**Preventive Care:** Certain OTC drugs, such as multivitamins, supplements, and contraceptives, are used for preventive care, helping individuals maintain their health and well-being.

**First Aid:** OTC drugs like pain relievers, antiseptics, and adhesive bandages are essential components of first-aid kits, used to treat minor injuries and wounds.

**Dietary Supplements:** Many people use OTC dietary supplements to complement their diets, aiming to address nutritional deficiencies or support specific health goals.

OTC drugs provide convenient access to medications, allowing individuals to quickly address minor health concerns without the need for a prescription or a visit to a healthcare provider. However, due to their accessibility and cost-effectiveness, misuse and addiction have become major concerns for OTCs, as described by [Schifano et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.657397). According to the review, misuse most often occurs in patients already suffering from health conditions or psychiatric disorders, with cough mixtures containing dextromethorphan (DXM), codeine, and nasal decongestants containing pseudoephedrine being common sources of misuse.

It is also important to note that these medications can still have side effects, even though they are generally considered safe. For example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen or aspirin can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, or gastrointestinal bleeding, especially with long-term or high-dose use.

## Prescriptions

Prescription drugs are typically more potent and specialized but may also be more harmful or addictive than over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. In North America, ℞, usually printed as "Rx," is used as an abbreviation for the word "prescription." Therefore, a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider, such as a physician, nurse practitioner, or dentist, is required. These medications are regulated by government agencies to ensure their safety, efficacy, and proper use.

A major concern in this class of drugs is antibiotic resistance, which refers to the ability of pathogens (organisms that we want to kill) to gain resistance through the misuse or overuse of antibiotics. The exact mechanisms behind antibiotic resistance are complex, and we will discuss it later in this tutorial. In general, to reduce antibiotic resistance, it is important for patients to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed.

## Illegal Drugs

Illegal drugs are often highly addictive and harmful to the body and are not commonly used for the treatment of diseases due to their side effects greatly outweighing their benefits. The definition and list of illegal drugs vary between countries, and some drugs classified as illegal may actually be available by prescription in others. Common illegal drugs include 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), and phencyclidine (PCP).

## Pharmacopeia Websites

**Pharmacopeia** refers to an official publication containing a list of medicinal drugs with their effects and directions for their use. Depending on the country, pharmacopeia can be found on different government websites:
