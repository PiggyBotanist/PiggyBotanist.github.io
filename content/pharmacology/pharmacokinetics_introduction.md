# Introduction to Pharmacokinetics

## Introduction

As mentioned in the introduction, pharmacokinetics studies how the body interacts with drugs through absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME). Before we talk about each individually, there are a few fundamental concepts you should understand.

## The Fluid Mosaic Model

When we talk about medications, it is really hard not to mention some fundamental concepts from cell biology and physiology. But don't panic; they won't be so hard to understand.

Just like the skin that separates our internal organs from the external environment, the biological membrane is a layer of **phospholipid bilayer** that separates the content inside the cell from the content outside the cell.

In chemistry, there is a term called hydrophobic, which literally means "water-fearing," and a term hydrophilic, which means "water-loving." Interchangeably, lipophilic and lipophobic can also be used, and you guessed it, it literally means "lipid-loving" and "lipid-fearing."

Phospholipids are a type of amphipathic molecule (a molecule with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions) where one fatty acid from a triglyceride molecule is removed and replaced with a phosphate group (1 phosphate group, 2 fatty acids, and 1 glycerol).

The **fluid mosaic model** describes that these biological membranes are:
- Semi-permeable
