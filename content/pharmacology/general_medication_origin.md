# Medication Sourcing and Origins

## Sources of Medication

In modern medicine, medication refers to the active ingredient or one specific chemical exerting effect on our body. These are often **purified** from natural sources and through the study of such compounds, more efficacious **synthetic** forms are created.

In general, sources of modern medicine can be divided into:

- Natural Derivatives
- Semi-Synthetic
- Synthetic

## Natural Source of Medication

### Plant Derivatives

The use of medicinal plants can date back to ancient Sumeria (3,000 BC), where hundreds of medicinal plants are listed on clay tablets. Although ancient people didn't understand the mechanisms behind them, our ancestors learned to use these plants for curing diseases.

Since the 19th century, active compounds in these plants have been constantly discovered and purified to create what we now know as medicine. Some well-known plant-derived drugs include:

- **Morphine:** derived from the opium poppy (*Papaver somniferum*), used as a pain reliever.
- **Aspirin:** originally derived from willow bark, used as a pain reliever and anti-inflammatory agent.
- **Quinine:** derived from the bark of the cinchona tree, used to treat malaria.
- **Digitalis:** derived from the foxglove plant, used to treat heart conditions.

### Animal Derivatives

With advancements in modern medicine and an understanding of physiology, some well-understood compounds derived from animals are also used as medication. For example:

- **Insulin:** originally extracted from the pancreas of pigs and cows, used to treat diabetes.
- **Heparin:** derived from the mucosal tissues of pigs and cows, used as an anticoagulant.
- **Conotoxins:** derived from the venom of cone snails, used as pain relievers and in neurological research.

### Microorganism-Derived Drugs

Studies of microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and algae have also allowed us to identify a variety of bioactive compounds, mostly for the use of antibiotics. Examples include:

- **Penicillin:** derived from the fungus *Penicillium*, used as an antibiotic.
- **Streptomycin:** derived from the bacterium *Streptomyces*, used as an antibiotic.
- **Cyclosporine:** derived from a fungus found in Norwegian soil, used as an immunosuppressant.
- **Artemisinin:** derived from the sweet wormwood plant, used as an antimalarial.

## Semi-Synthetic Compounds

Some drugs are derived from natural sources but undergo chemical modification to improve their properties. Examples include:

- Morphine derivatives: such as codeine and oxycodone, which are semi-synthetic opioids used as pain relievers.
- Penicillin derivatives: such as amoxicillin and ampicillin, which are semi-synthetic antibiotics derived from the natural compound penicillin.
- Statins: such as lovastatin and atorvastatin, which are semi-synthetic cholesterol-lowering drugs derived from natural compounds found in fungi.

## Synthetic Compounds

Many drugs are synthesized through chemical reactions in laboratories. Examples include:

- Acetaminophen (paracetamol): used as a pain reliever and fever reducer.
- Albuterol: used as a bronchodilator to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- Simvastatin: used to lower cholesterol levels in the treatment of hyperlipidemia.
- Metformin: used to treat type 2 diabetes by lowering blood sugar levels.
