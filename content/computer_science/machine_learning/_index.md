**Machine Learning** is a subset of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** focused on the development of algorithms and statistical models that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Machine learning can be broadly divided into several key areas:
- **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning both the input data and the correct output are provided.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm is given data without labels and must find patterns or groupings within it.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns through trial and error by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
- **Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning**: These methods combine elements of both supervised and unsupervised learning, leveraging a mix of labeled and unlabeled data.

Although **Deep Learning**, which focuses on neural networks with many layers, is a specialized subfield within machine learning, it is often discussed as a separate area due to its complexity and applications.

In this section, we will focus on the key machine learning techniques that have widespread applications across different domains.
